        <li> &lt;p&gt;tag: This element represents a paragraph.</li>
        <li>&lt;a&gt; tag: The &lt;a&gt; HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink
            to web pages, files,
            email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</li>
        <li>&lt;from&gt; tag: The &lt;from&gt; HTML element represents a document section containing interactive
            controls for submitting information.</li>
        <li>&lt;input&gt; tag: The &lt;input&gt; HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms
            in order to accept data
            from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the
            device and user agent.</li>
        <li>&lt;mark&gt; tag: The &lt;mark&gt; HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference
            or notation purposes
            due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.</li>
        <li>&lt;s&gt; tag: The &lt;s&gt; HTML element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the
            &lt;s&gt; element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.
        </li>
        <li>&lt;span&gt; tag: The &lt;span&gt; HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which
            does not inherently
            represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id
            attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.</li>
        <li>&lt;sub&gt; tag: The &lt;sub&gt; HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript
            for solely typographical
            reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</li>
        <li>&lt;sup&gt; tag: The &lt;sup&gt; HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript
            for solely
            typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.</li>
        <li>&lt;section&gt; tag:The &lt;section&gt; HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document,
            which doesn't have a more
            specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few
            exceptions.</li>
        <li>&lt;button&gt; tag: The &lt;button&gt; HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a
            mouse, keyboard, finger,
            voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as
            submitting a form or opening a dialog.</li>
        <li>&lt;data&gt; tag: The &lt;data&gt; HTML element links a given piece of content with a machine-readable
            translation. If the content
            is time- or date-related, the <time> element must be used.</li>
    </ol>
